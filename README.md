## Pizza Bill Generator App
This Java project demonstrates a simple Pizza Bill Generator using object-oriented programming. Below is a breakdown of how the code works, including each class and its responsibilities
## How the Pizza Bill Generator works?
The application simulates a pizza store with two types of pizzas:
- Base Pizza (veg or non-veg, with optional add-ons)
- Deluxe Pizza (includes all add-ons by default)
Users can add extra cheese, extra toppings, and opt for takeaway (with an extra charge).
The app generates a detailed bill based on selections.
